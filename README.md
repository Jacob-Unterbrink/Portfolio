# Jacob Unterbrink - Data Science Portfolio
This repository serves to hold my completed data science papers and code. Please feel free to reach out with any questions (jacobunterbrink@ou.edu).

**Continuous Genetic Algorithm**: This genetic algorithm is designed to solve the 2D Schwefel Function. Even without tuning, it produces strong results. <br>
**IISE Conference Paper**: This paper was submitted to the 2023 IISE annual conference in New Orleans. I was the primary author, although recommendations and adjustments were made by my collaborators. <br>
**Masters Capstone Final Paper**: This paper reflects a semester-long project that was completed as part of OU's data science capstone. The work was supervised by Dr. Charles Nicholson. <br>

Note that this repository was made recently, and is therefore sparse. I intend to upload more work samples soon.
